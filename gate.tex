\item [(A)]It can be used  for dividing the input frequency by $3$ .
\item [(B)] It can be used  for dividing the input frequency by $5$ .
\item [(C)] It can be used  for dividing the input frequency by $7$ .
\item [(D)] It cannot be reliably used as frequency divider due to 
 disjoint internal cycles .
